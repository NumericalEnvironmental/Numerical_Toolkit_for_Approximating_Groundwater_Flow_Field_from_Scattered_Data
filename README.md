# Numerical_Toolkit_for_Approximating_Groundwater_Flow_Field_from_Scattered_Data

This Julia script imports and interpolates scattered hydraulic head and hydraulic conductivity data (for a single-layer aquifer) using ordinary kriging. The interpolation function serves as a basis for several groundwater flow assessment tools, including (1) a gridding function for subsequent plotting, (2) groundwater velocity vector estimation as a function of location, (3) forward and backward particle tracking, and (4) numerical integration of groundwater fluxes along a user-supplied polyline or polygon. Additional information and a summary of an example application can be found on my blog, [link pending].
The script runs under Julia 1.0 or later, and requires the following packages: DelimitedFiles, Statistics, Polynomials, and QuadGK. Text-based input files include the following:
* grid.txt – model boundaries (and grid resolution to support plotting)
* heads.txt – groundwater elevations over (x, y)
* logKs.txt – log hydraulic conductivity values over (x, y)
* particleStarts.txt – starting locations and migration direction for particle tracks; read if trackFlag is set = true
* trackParams.txt – porosity and particle step size; read if trackFlag is set = true
* polygon.txt – apex points for polyline/polygon for flux integration; read if polyFlag is set = true
* wells.txt – well locations and pumping rates; if wellFlag is set = true (pumping rates not used in current version)

I'd appreciate hearing back from you if you find the code useful. Questions or comments are welcome at walt.mcnab@gmail.com.
